            <h2 class="text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-bold mb-6">What Students Want from AI (And What They're Still Not Getting)</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                There's a palpable fear of being left behind if they don't embrace these College AI tools, with students expressing concern about being disadvantaged if they don't adopt AI Assistant platforms or Writing AI. Students desire AI that offers a more human-like conversational experience; they "emphasize ChatGPT's ability to prompt and engage in natural conversations" for academic support (Digital Education Council, 2024) and appreciate its ability to "engage in natural conversations with users, without relying on complex natural language processing" (Digital Education Council, 2024). This preference for intuitive and natural interaction highlights a desire for Paper AI that mimics a knowledgeable peer. That said, there is a definite concern regarding the lack of well-defined policies about the fair use of College AI. Students are looking for guidelines that make sense, with a strong preference for institutions to teach them how to use AI Assistant tools responsibly rather than simply banning it. "I don't want to get left behind because I can't afford premium Writing AI tools," illustrates the concern about equitable access and the potential for a "tech privilege" gap in College AI.

            <p class="mb-4">
                The integration of Paper AI and AI Assistant into academia is not without its hurdles, leading to significant pain points for students. A considerable proportion of students worry about receiving incorrect information from Writing AI. This "too good to be true" sentiment is widespread, with 47% expressing skepticism about AI Assistant capabilities (ACM Digital Library, 2024) and 65% concerned about the reliability of AI-generated content (Digital Education Council, 2024). Students often struggle to verify Paper AI output accuracy, with 71% facing this challenge (Educational Technology Research, 2024).
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                A major source of anxiety is the fear of false accusations of cheating due to unreliable AI detection tools. As one student recounts, "I got flagged for cheating because of an AI detector glitch—and I didn't even use ChatGPT." This fear is not unfounded, as non-native English speakers and scholars with unique writing styles worry about being wrongly accused of Paper AI cheating (Giray, 2024). Students report having been wrongly accused of cheating and being given failing grades by unreliable Writing AI detection tools. The socioeconomic divide plays a significant role in College AI access and attitudes, with higher-income students more amenable to ChatGPT use than their lower-income counterparts, which highlights a concerning "tech privilege" and economic disparity in AI Assistant tool accessibility.

                A critical concern among students is the potential negative impact of AI Assistant on fundamental learning processes. Many students worry that over-reliance on Paper AI could erode their critical thinking skills, with 49% expressing this concern (Vee, 2025). "It's easy to rely on Writing AI too much—sometimes I wonder if I'm thinking less," is a common sentiment. Indeed, 50% of students believe over-reliance negatively impacts academic performance (Digital Education Council, 2024).
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                There's a fear that College AI might foster a dependence on tools rather than encouraging genuine effort and deeper understanding. Students are concerned that critical thinking abilities will be lost as a result of AI over-use. While Paper AI can aid in brainstorming, there's also concern about its potential to stifle true creativity; some students "see it as a threat to creative fields that encourages and enables bad academic habits" (ACM Digital Library, 2024).

            <p class="mb-4">
                In the absence of clear institutional guidelines, students are often creating their own informal rules of engagement for AI. Many students develop personal rules, such as using Writing AI for brainstorming but ensuring they write their own content, which indicates an effort to balance AI assistance with maintaining personal integrity. Discussions within peer groups and group chats are common, where students collectively define what's considered acceptable and what crosses ethical lines; "We talk about it in our group chat—what's okay and what's not," exemplifies this collaborative approach to navigating Paper AI ethics. Furthermore, students are actively trying to learn when and how to trust College AI output, developing a form of AI-literacy, which is crucial in an environment where formal training may be lacking.

            <h2 class="text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-bold mb-6">Conclusion: AI Is Here to Stay — But Students Want a Say</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                AI's role in academic life is undeniably transformative and permanent. From acting as a research assistant and writing helper to a coding sidekick and study partner, College AI has cemented its place in the daily routines of US college students. The statistics are clear: more US college students are using Paper AI for school-related purposes than ever before, with usage rates rising sharply last year. ChatGPT is particularly popular, with 64.77% of students reporting usage in the past month (Primary Research Group, 2025).
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                However, this widespread adoption comes with significant challenges and concerns. There is a dramatic contrast between high AI usage and low student preparedness: while College AI use is common, 85% of undergraduates say they would feel more comfortable using Writing AI if it were developed and regulated specifically for education, indicating uncertainty and a need for more guidance (Statista, 2025). Policy gaps are also apparent, as 55% of students admit to using Paper AI against school policies yet only a small fraction are fully satisfied with current guidelines. The support gap is evident as well: only 42% of students say staff are well-equipped to help with AI, despite high student usage (Primary Research Group, 2025). Dissatisfaction with university College AI support remains high, highlighting a clear and urgent need for institutional improvement.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                These insights underscore the critical importance of incorporating student voices in shaping the future rules and integration of Writing AI, Paper AI, AI Assistant, and College AI in education. It's no longer a question of whether AI Assistants will be used, but how it will be used responsibly and effectively to enhance, rather than hinder, genuine learning. As students themselves implore, "Don't just ban it—teach us how to use it right." Their experiences, concerns, and desires are paramount in navigating this evolving academic landscape.
